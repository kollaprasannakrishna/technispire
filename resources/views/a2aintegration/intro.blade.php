                <p class="text-justify">The increasingly competitive global marketplace pushes companies to evolve business and IT

                    strategies faster than ever. Rapidly expanding businesses evolve via new markets, initiatives,

                    mergers and acquisitions, and other growth strategies, and the kind of file transfer technology

                    needed to keep up — let alone make competitive gains. This often leads to an infrastructure

                    comprised of complex, disparate systems that create inefficient business exchanges.</p><br>
                <p class="text-justify">Companies must enable future growth initiatives via a sustainable architecture for enterprise

                    integration that also supports with a company’s B2B.integration and data.transformation needs. This

                    foundation will help drive both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, while also lowering

                    the total cost of ownership.
