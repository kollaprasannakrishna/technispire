            <p class="text-justify">Technispire Managed Services provides 24/7, multi-lingual, support

                coverage. This helps users across an extended enterprise receive the

                help they need, in any language or any time zone around the world. With

                many companies establishing manufacturing operations in low cost

                countries such as China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America, it is

                becoming increasingly important to be able to support trading partners

                within these particular regions of the world.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Implementing an outsourced approach to managing the integration

                between SAP and a B2B platform will help to ensure that your business

                realises even greater levels of return on your investment. Cloud, mobile

                and SAP HANA may provide a good incentive to upgrade and

                consolidate SAP instances but integrating seamlessly to a trading partner

                community should also be high on a CIO’s agenda. Therefore I think it

                is fairly safe to say that without B2B integration to outside trading

                partners, an ERP environment could be considered ‘incomplete’,

                Technispire Managed Services helps to ‘complete ERP’.
